# Grocery-management-system
1. INTRODUCTION 
E-commerce is fast gaining ground as an accepted and used business paradigm. More and more 
business houses are implementing web sites providing functionality for performing commercial 
transactions over the web. It is reasonable to say that the process of shopping on the web is 
becoming commonplace. 
The objective of this project is to develop a general-purpose e-commerce store where Grocery 
product can be bought from the comfort of home through the Internet. However, for 
implementation purposes, this paper will deal with an online shopping for Grocery.
 # TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY USED 
 
This website Development is possible with a couple of software and development kits to support 
the software and execution, they are as follows, 
 
# Microsoft Visual Studio 
Visual Studio Code is a free, lightweight but powerful source code editor that runs on your 
desktop and on the web and is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi OS. It 
comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem 
of extensions for other programming languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, and Go), 
runtimes (such as .NET and Unity), environments (such as Docker and Kubernetes), and clouds 
(such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform).
 
# FRONT END DETAILS 
Front End tool is used for give a Graphical user interface to system. By this we can make a 
system user friendly and more capable. I have chosen PHP as front-end tool. Because it is an 
Open-Source Technology, freely available and more familiar with any type of database. 
 
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT are utilized to implement the frontend.
# BACKEND DETAILS 
Back-end part of a system is more important because it controls all the internal process of a 
system. I have chosen MySQL database as back end. Because it is word’s Most Capable 
relational database and provide more security than others.
# Why MySQL? 
MySQL is the world's most popular open-source database software, with over 100 million 
copies of its software downloaded or distributed throughout its history. With its superior speed, 
reliability, and ease of use, MySQL has become the preferred choice for Web, Web 2.0, SaaS, 
ISV, Telecom companies and forward-thinking corporate IT Managers because it eliminates 
the major problems associated with downtime, maintenance and administration for modern, 
online applications. 
Many of the world's largest and fastest-growing organizations use MySQL to save time and 
money powering their high-volume Web sites, critical business systems, and packaged 
software — including industry leaders such as Yahoo!, Alcatel-Lucent, Google, Nokia, 
YouTube, Wikipedia, and Booking.com.
 # IMPLEMENTATION 
Implementation is the stage in the project where the theoretical design is turned into the 
working system and is giving confidence to the new system for the users i.e., will work 
efficiently and effectively. It involves careful planning, investigation of the current system and 
its constraints on implementation, design of method to achieve the changeover, an evaluation, 
of change over methods. A part from planning major task of preparing the implementation is 
education of users. The more complex system is implemented, the more involved will be the 
system analysis and design effort required just for implementation. The implementation process 
begins with preparing a plan for the implementation for the system. According to this plan, the 
activities are to be carried out; discussions may regarding the equipment have to be acquired 
to implement the new system. 
Implementation is the final and important phase. The most critical stage is in achieving a 
successful new system and in giving the users confidence that the new system will work and 
be effective. The system can be implemented only after thorough testing is done and if it found 
to working according to the specification. This method also offers the greatest security since 
the old system can take over if the errors are found or inability to handle certain types of 
transaction while using the new system. 
At the beginning of the development phase a preliminary implementation plan is created to 
schedule and manage the many different activities that must be integrated into plan. The 
implementation plan is updated throughout the Development phase, culminating in a 
changeover plan for the operation phase. The major elements of implementation plan are test 
plan, training plan, equipment installation plan, and a conversion plan.
